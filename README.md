# Conference

Radiant is _so_ freaking awesome, but I made it better through this extension. Our conference extension integrates with Readers using readers groups. Registered readers can subscribe for conference themselves via PxPay or the registrant (secretary) can register readers who send in the paper registration form and pay by other means. This extension provides registration for whole of conference or day options.
